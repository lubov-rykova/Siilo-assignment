# Spec review

## Common
* All input fields expand if the value inside is long (even beyond the screen). There is nothing about it in the spec, but it doesn't look correct.

## 1 Registration flow: welcome screen
* Content text contains emoji which are not in the spec. Seems like the spec might be incomplete.
* Header text is not bold in the spec, but it makes sense for it to be bold because other headers are bold.

## 5 Registration flow: professions screen
* Header text is not bold in the spec, but it makes sense for it to be bold because other headers are bold.

## 8 Registration flow: phone number screen
* Country code selection screen spec is completely absent.
* Phone number field spec is incomplete. For example, county prefix can be erased manually, but it should be fixed for the selected country.
